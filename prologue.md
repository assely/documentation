Assely is a PHP framework which brings a little joy to the WordPress development. Develop structured, easily scalable and complex WordPress websites and web applications with true pleasure.

### [Understanding assumptions](#understanding-assumptions)

Today, WordPress development is pretty rough and messy. The Assely framework aims to introduce some standardized and comfortable ways for creating WordPress powered applications. We still have a long way to go, but we believe that it is possible.

However, you have to understand where it works the best. Here are some answers that can be helpful:

##### Just starting the PHP and WordPress adventure?

> ***No***, your first WordPress theme should not be based on the Assely framework. It favors modern and advanced concepts. Grow as the developer and come back, you will appreciate it twice.

##### Creating a theme which will be widely distributed?

> ***Probably no.*** Assely brings a lot of awesome goodies but breaks both [standard](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development) and [child theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) development workflow. It is not a standard WordPress theme, you have to take this into account.

##### Creating an advanced website, which will be continuously developed?

> ***Definitely.*** Better organization, understandable structure, patterns and modern principles. You will love it, just dig in into the documentation.
