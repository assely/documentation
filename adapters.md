## [Introduction](#introduction)

The Assely framework introduces Adapters for one important reason â€” to unify and enhance WordPress core objects. You will have access to various methods previously unavailable directly on core objects.

## [Adapter's properties](#adapters-properties)

Do you remember how often you had var_dump to recall under what property name this `id` of object is? Once it is `id`, some other time `ID`, even `term_id` and `comment_ID`. What a mess. That is one of the tiniest, but most annoing things. Now, you can forget about it.

## [Serializing Adapters](#serializing-adapters)

Adapters are easily convertible to Array and JSON. It's useful especially when you want to pass your objects to the frontend.

<a name="serializing-to-array"></a>
### [Serializing to Array](#serializing-to-array)

The `toArray` method converts the adapter instance into a standard PHP `array`.

```php
Post::find(1)->toArray();

/*
[
    'id' => 1,
    'parent' => 0,
    'created_at' => '2016-06-15 20:22:08',
    'modified_at' => '2016-06-19 08:20:18',
    (...)
]
*/
```

<a name="serializing-to-json"></a>
### [Serializing to JSON](#serializing-to-json)

The `toJson` method converts the adapter instance into a JSON.

```php
Post::find(1)->toJson();

/*
{
    id: '1',
    parent: '0',
    created_at: '2016-06-15 20:22:08',
    modified_at: '2016-06-19 08:20:18',
    (...)
}
*/
```

```php
// Gets the WP_Post object
Post::find(1)->getAdaptee();
```
